# Notification-Center-FrontendMentorChallenge
The challenge was to make a notification center look and act as closely as possible to the product given.

Your users should be able to: 

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
